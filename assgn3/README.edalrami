For this assignment my main contribution was handling the data log files of each algorithm to produce something that we as a team could analyze. I did give input when my other team members were editing the original files to implement the fat chance algorithm, but not as much as Marko and Jeremiah. My main contribution was creating visuals from the data collected that we could analyze. In order to do this, I imported the log files into Microsoft Excel and edited certain parts of the data so that MATLAB could read it in as a CSV file. I wrote all of the MATLAB scripts for each algorithm that handled all of our output for each scan, and plotted the figures. Notice, that the scripts that produce figures for the algorithms with no stress are much shorter than the scripts that I wrote for the algorithms under stress. This is because our data for the algorithms under stress was handling about 100,000 lines of data being read from 20 runs collected, and I had to calculate the average number of scans for each run and plot the respective average output. This involved a lot a Matrix manipulation to do so. For the algorithms without stress, we did not record multiple runs, and those figures illustrate the data for those algorithms during bootup, so those scripts were only reading in about a couple hundred lines of data. Overall, I created these figures for us to analyze, and explained them to the rest of the team.

As for my other team members Nikola is the one who edited the code from the default algorithm to the fatchance algorithm mainly on his laptop. Marko and Jeremiah also helped out in some regards to this by researching each of the methods we edited in the files. Jeremiah and Marko mostly helped out Nikola in looking over the functions and files that we edited and helped make sure that our edits logically made sense. Marko also helped with the writeup up of our document, and wrote most of the analysis for the figures that illustrated both algorithms under stress. Nikola and Jeremiah also both did the write up for the analysis of the algorithms under no stress. Additionally, Marko collected the data that I used to produce the figures by running the algorithms with stress on his computer 20 times each.
